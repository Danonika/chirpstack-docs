# Raspberry Pi install

## ChirpStack Gateway OS

ChirpStack provides an embedded OS called the [ChirpStack Gateway OS](/gateway-os/)
which supports Raspberry Pi based gateways. Please refer to the
[ChirpStack Gateway OS](/gateway-os/) documentation for more information and
[Raspberry Pi installation](/gateway-os/install/raspberrypi/) instructions.

## Raspbian

As an alternative to the [ChirpStack Gateway OS](/gateway-os/), it is also possible
to install the ChirpStack stack on top of [Raspbian](http://raspbian.org/). As
Raspbian is based on Debian, you can follow the [Quickstart Debian / Ubuntu]({{<relref "debian-ubuntu.md">}})
guide.
