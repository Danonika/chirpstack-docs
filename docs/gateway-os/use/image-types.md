# Image types

## `chirpstack-gateway-os-base`

The **chirpstack-gateway-os-base** image provides all the features and components
to operate a LoRa gateway.

### ChirpStack Concentratord

The [ChirpStack Concentratord](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-concentratord)
is an open-source concentrator daemon which is responsible for the configuration
and communication with the SX1301 / SX1302 based chipset.

### ChirpStack Gateway Bridge

The [ChirpStack Gateway Bridge](../../gateway-bridge/index.md) is a service which converts
LoRa<sup>&reg;</sup> Packet Forwarder protocols into a JSON or Protobuf over
MQTT. It connects to the Concentratord using [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/).

## `chirpstack-gateway-os-full`

The **chirpstack-gateway-os-full** provides all the features of the
**chirpstack-gateway-os-base** image, but also comes with [ChirpStack Network Server](../../network-server/index.md)
and [ChirpStack Application Server](../../application-server/index.md) installed, including all requirements.
This makes it possible to run the complete LoRaWAN<sup>&reg;</sup> infrastructure **on** the
gateway. This is intended for small deployments or getting started with LoRaWAN.

### ChirpStack Network Server

[ChirpStack Network Server](../../network-server/index.md) is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server implementation.

### ChirpStack Application Server

[ChirpStack Application Server](../../application-server/index.md) is an open-source LoRaWAN Application Server
and web-interface for managing the gateway, applications and devices.
